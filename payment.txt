1. Start

2. Define a PaymentStrategy interface with a method for processing payment:
   a. Interface: PaymentStrategy
      i. Method: processPayment(amount)

3. Create concrete implementations for each payment strategy:
   a. CreditCardPayment class implements PaymentStrategy:
      i. Override processPayment(amount) with credit card payment logic.

   b. PayPalPayment class implements PaymentStrategy:
      i. Override processPayment(amount) with PayPal payment logic.

   c. BitCoinPayment class implements PaymentStrategy:
      i. Override processPayment(amount) with BitCoin payment logic.

4. Create a ShoppingCart class that utilizes the PaymentStrategy:
   a. Properties: List of items, selectedPaymentStrategy.
   b. Method: checkout() - Calls the processPayment() method of the selectedPaymentStrategy.

5. In the client code (e.g., main program or test class):
   a. Instantiate a ShoppingCart.
   b. Add items to the shopping cart.
   c. Set the payment strategy based on the user's choice (Credit Card, PayPal, or BitCoin).
   d. Call the checkout() method on the ShoppingCart, which, in turn, invokes the selected payment strategy.

6. End

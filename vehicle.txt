Algorithm for Common Functionalities in Vehicles:

1. Gear Change:
   - The changeGear method should take an integer parameter representing the new gear.
   - Update the current gear of the vehicle with the provided value.

2. Speed Up:
   - The speedUp method should take an integer parameter representing the speed increment.
   - Increase the current speed of the vehicle by the provided speed increment.

3. Apply Brakes:
   - The applyBrakes method should take an integer parameter representing the brake force.
   - Decrease the current speed of the vehicle by the provided brake force.

Bicycle Class Implementation:

1. Gear Change (Bicycle):
   - Print a message indicating that the bicycle is changing gears.
   - Update the current gear of the bicycle.

2. Speed Up (Bicycle):
   - Print a message indicating that the bicycle is speeding up.
   - Increase the current speed of the bicycle.

3. Apply Brakes (Bicycle):
   - Print a message indicating that the brakes are being applied on the bicycle.
   - Decrease the current speed of the bicycle.

Bike Class Implementation:

1. Gear Change (Bike):

   b. Iterate through each element in the collection.
   c. If an element is an odd number, increment the odd counter.

6. Counting Prime Numbers:
   a. Initialize a counter variable for prime numbers.
   b. Iterate through each element in the collection.
   c. Check if the element is a prime number; if yes, increment the prime counter.

7. Counting Palindromes:
   a. Initialize a counter variable for palindromes.
   b. Iterate through each element in the collection.
   c. Check if the element is a palindrome; if yes, increment the palindrome counter.

8. Display the counts for each category (even, odd, prime, palindrome).
